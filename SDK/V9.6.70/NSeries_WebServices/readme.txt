=================================
N-Series Web Services API SDK
=================================

This directory contains the schema for the N-Series Web Services API.
This API CANNOT be used directly - instead, it must be access via the
Network-Wide Web Services API, and so applications should be developed against
the schema defined in the NWSAP_WebServices part of the SDK (which will pull
in the relevant parts of the N-Series schema from this directory.
For information about using this interface please see the "MetaView APIs
Programmer's Guide".
