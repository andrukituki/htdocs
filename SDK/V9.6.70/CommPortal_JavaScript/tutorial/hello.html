<h1>Hello World - CommPortal SDK Tutorial</h1>

For more than 30 years, the classic introduction to any coding environment has
been a program to say "Hello World!"

<p>
And this first CommPortal SDK Tutorial follows in that great tradition.
We're a little more ambitious, though - rather than greeting the whole world,
we'll give the subscriber a chance to log in, and we'll even tell them how many
new voicemails messages are waiting in their mailbox.

<h2>Contents</h2>

<div id="tableOfContents"></div>

<h2>Try this out on a working server</h2>

The form below is running the code behind this example.  To try it out, fill
in the URL of your CommPortal server (including the customization), then
press the button.

<p>
If everything works properly, you'll get a CommPortal popup asking for a
subscriber's phone number and password.  Then once you've logged in, you'll see
a simple JavaScript alert telling you how many voicemail messages the
subscriber has waiting for them.

<p>
If the CommPortal popup loads something other than a plain login page you'll
need to include, in the URL of your CommPortal server, the path to the login
page.  Normally the login page is located under your customization as
"domain/cust/login.html".

<p>
Feel free to try to break it, as well - if you hit an error, you'll see
another popup explaining what's wrong.  Depending on the exact problem, you
may also be left with an empty login window; if that happens, just close it.

<h2>API calls</h2>

Here are the CommPortal API calls we've used in this example:

<ul>
  <li><b>login()</b></li>
  <li><b>fetchSubscriberNumber()</b></li>
  <li><b>fetchVoicemailCount()</b></li>
  <li><b>logout()</b></li>
</ul>

As this is the first tutorial, we'll also cover two key concepts:

<ul>
  <li>how to include the CommPortal API file</li>
  <li>how to work with the API's asynchronous model - where, rather than having a
      return code to provide the requested data, many API calls take the name
      of a function to call back.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The complete code</h2>

Here's the complete code of this example.  It's not very long, but we'll
explain each section in detail below.

<code id="#all" class="html"></code>

<h2>A little bit of explanation</h2>

The first thing the code does is to include the CommPortal API file.  You'll
always need to do this to get access to the CommPortal API calls.

<code id="includeAPI" class="html"></code>

The next part of the HTML file covers the simple form you've seen near the top
of this page.  There's nothing fancy here - we're just providing somewhere
to specify which CommPortal server to connect to.  In fact, in a real
program, you might well hard-code the CommPortal URL and not need this part of
the UI at all.

<p>
The real business of this example starts with the function <i>pressed()</i>,
which the form calls when the user presses the button.

<code id="#all" class="function pressed"></code>

<p>
The first thing this function does is to find out what you've entered in the
form, then use that to issue a <b>new CommPortal()</b> call. We need to call
<b>new CommPortal()</b> to get in touch with the CommPortal
server... but note, we're anonymous at this point; we haven't logged in yet.

<p>
So, next, the code calls the <b>login()</b> API to bring up the standard
CommPortal login prompt.  This is our first example of an asynchronous API call
- after all, the subscriber may take their time to type in their login details.
So the API call takes the names of two functions: one to be called if the
subscriber successfully logs in, and one to be called if there is an error.

<p>
Let's look at the error case first.  We've provided a function called
<i>handleError()</i>:

<code id="#all" class="function handleError"></code>

To keep this example simple, we just pop up the error.  In real code, of course,
you'll do something much more user-friendly; perhaps even checking
for specific errors and dealing with them individually.

<p>
So, what if the subscriber does manage to log in?  We've provided the
<i>loginSuccess()</i> function to handle that:

<code id="#all" class="function loginSuccess"></code>

<p>
Like most API callbacks, this function receives the <i>connection</i> object
back as a parameter, allowing us to use it to make further API calls.  We also
receive a parameter called <i>sessionId</i>, but we won't make any use of that
in this example (in case you're wondering, you can use it to correlate with
web server logs).

<p>
In the function, we ask CommPortal to tell us exactly <i>who</i> has logged in,
by calling the <b>fetchSubscriberNumber()</b> API.
Because this is also an asynchronous action, we again provide the names
of two functions: one to be called on success, the other if an error occurs.

<p>
We've already looked at <i>handleError()</i>; here's the success case,
<i>gotNumber()</i>.

<code id="#all" class="function gotNumber"></code>

You've probably got the feel for this now: we call another API function,
<b>fetchVoicemailCount()</b>, to get the count of voicemails.  It's
no surprise that this is also an asynchronous action taking two functions
as parameters.

<p>
By the way, if you're wondering why we saved off the number in <i>subscriberNumber</i>,
it's just because we want to use it in the <i>gotCount()</i> success function.
Here it comes:

<code id="#all" class="function gotCount"></code>

<p>
CommPortal passes <i>gotCount()</i> two numbers: the total number of messages
in the subscriber's mailbox, and the number they haven't heard.  And with this
information, we can finally say hello - telling the subscriber both their
phone number, and the count of new messages waiting for them!

<p>
There's one final task: to tidy things up and release resources on the
CommPortal server, we call the <b>logout()</b> function.  If we'd forgotten
to do that, CommPortal would have reserved some resources for the connection
until the timeout interval expired.


<h2>What next?</h2>

This initial tutorial has quickly taken you through a complete example -
but we've skipped over some of the alternative choices you could have made
along the way.  We'll explore these in the follow-up
<a href="login.html">Login tutorial</a>, which digs into login options in
a little more detail.
