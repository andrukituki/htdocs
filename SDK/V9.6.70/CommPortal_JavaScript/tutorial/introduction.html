<h1>Introduction - CommPortal SDK Tutorial</h1>

Thank you for accessing the CommPortal SDK.  This includes a number of
tutorial examples which will help you learn how to use the CommPortal SDK API.

<h2>Contents</h2>

<div id="tableOfContents"></div>

<h2>Assumptions</h2>

These tutorials assume that you have some basic knowledge of JavaScript,
but the code sticks to simple constructs to make it easy to follow.
If you have more advanced JavaScript experience, then you may well spot
more elegant ways to do things than are presented here.

<h2>Before you start</h2>

In order to get the most out of these tutorials, you'll need the following:
<ul>
  <li>Access to a CommPortal server, with at least one user provisioned on it</li>
  <li>A web server to host these tutorials - this can be running on localhost</li>
  <li>The zip file containing these tutorial files</li>
  <li>A text editor to view and edit the code files</li>
</ul>

Code files provided as part of these tutorials have been developed on
Windows machines, and thus follow Windows line ending conventions.

<p>
To view the tutorial you'll need a web browser.  Until very recently,
by far the best browser to use when developing web pages was
<a href="http://www.getfirefox.com">Firefox</a>,
specifically because of the powerful
<a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> web development environment
which was available for it.

<p>
With the recent release of Microsoft's IE8 on the Windows platform, this
web browser has been updated so that it also includes many Firebug-inspired
features, which makes it a good second choice.  When you do
produce your own web pages, you should be careful to check that they work
in both Firefox and IE. In fact, in the case of IE, you should probably
be checking them out in all widespread versions of IE, namely
IE6, IE7 and IE8.

<h3>Placing the tutorial files on your web server</h3>

To access these tutorials, you need to unzip the CommPortal SDK file, and to
place the resultant set of directories on your web server.

<p>
You can then point your browser at the "tutorials/starthere.html" file
to get a simple page that gives access to all the other tutorials.

<h2>Tutorial Conventions</h2>

Within this tutorial, the following conventions are used:

<h3>Functions within the examples</h3>

Internal functions whose code is supplied as part of the example are written
as <i>display()</i> or <i>play()</i>

<h3>API calls</h3>

Functions which are provided in the CommPortal SDK API are written
as <b>login()</b> or <b>fetchContacts()</b>.

<h3>HTML code</h3>

<code class="html">
Examples in this style are HTML code, that should be placed in your HTML file.
</code>

<h3>JavaScript code</h3>

<code>
// Examples shown like this are JavaScript code, which can be placed within a
// script tag within your HTML file, or may be placed within a separate JavaScript
// file.
</code>

<h2>Helper functions</h2>

In order to demonstrate the CommPortal API, the fragments of tutorial code
make use of a function called <i>display()</i>.  This is not part of
the API, it is just a convenient function for the tutorial code to call in
order that in the working example at the bottom of the page you can see the
result of API calls.

<p>
A very simple implementation of </i>display()</i> would be to display each message
via the browser alert mechanism:

<code>
function display(text)
{
  alert(text);
}
</code>

However that gets a bit annoying over time, since you have to keep dismissing
the alerts that pop up, and there is no way to see previous messages.  The
implementation used in the live code below is to append the messages to the
body of the page - still very simple, but effective enough for our current needs.

<code id="tutorialFramework"></code>

<h2>Including the CommPortal API</h2>

The CommPortal JavaScript API must be included before you can use any of the
CommPortal API calls.  This is done using a script tag in the page header,
which should be included before any other scripts.  When copying this code you
will need to adjust the src url to reference the correct location.

<code class="html" id="includeAPI"></code>

This creates a global object called CommPortal, through which the whole of the
API is accessed.

<h2>What next?</h2>

You now have sufficient background to try the first tutorial - the
<a href="hello.html">Hello World</a> example for the CommPortal SDK.
